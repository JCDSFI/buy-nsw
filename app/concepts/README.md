Hello! The files in this directory are 'operations' from the [Trailblazer framework](http://trailblazer.to).

We've been moving away from these to build equivalent functionality as plain-old Ruby objects (POROs). These now live in `app/services`.

You can read more about this, and the rationale behind it, in `docs/technical_debt.md`.
