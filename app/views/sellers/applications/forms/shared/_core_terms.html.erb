  <h1>ICT Agreement Core Terms</h1>
  <p>Version: 7 May 2018</p>

  <h2>1. Role of the Core Terms</h2>

  <p>Each agreement between us (the <strong>buyer</strong>) and you (the <strong>supplier</strong>) consists of:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>these <strong>core terms</strong></li>
    <li>the relevant <strong>solution requirements</strong></li>
    <li>any documents attached to those <strong>solution requirements</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <strong>core terms</strong> are first in the list, and take priority over all other documents. They govern performance of the <strong>agreement</strong>, including how the solution described in the <strong>solution requirements</strong> will be supplied.</p>
  <p>Any terms contained in other parts of the <strong>agreement</strong> that conflict with, or limit the operation of, these core terms have no legal effect.</p>

  <h2>2. Your dealings with us</h2>

  <p>You confirm that all information you provide us is true, correct and not misleading whether by omission or otherwise.</p>
  <p>You confirm that you have not withheld any information from us you should reasonably know would change our decision to enter into the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>
  <p>A breach of either of the above is a breach of the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>

  <h2>3. Performance</h2>

  <p>You agree to perform the <strong>agreement</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>with due care and skill, consistent with relevant industry practice and standards</li>
    <li>working co-operatively with our other partners and suppliers</li>
    <li>in accordance with all applicable laws</li>
    <li>in accordance with our reasonable directions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. User material</h2>

  <p>You agree to make available and keep updated all user materials needed for optimal use of the solution described in the <strong>solution requirements</strong>.</p>

  <h2>5. Subcontracting</h2>

  <p>You must have our prior consent to subcontract any significant part of the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>
  <p>Any rights we grant to you are extended to your subcontractors on the same terms for the purpose of performing the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>
  <p>You are responsible for your subcontractors, and liable for their actions and omissions in performing the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>

  <h2>6. Confidential information</h2>

  <p>Where either party (<strong>recipient</strong>) receives information from the other (<strong>discloser</strong>) that is inherently confidential or is designated by the <strong>discloser</strong> as confidential, the <strong>recipient</strong> must keep it confidential and not disclose it to anyone other than:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>with the prior consent of the <strong>discloser</strong> on the condition that the recipient is bound by the same confidentiality requirements</li>
    <li>where required to perform the <strong>agreement</strong></li>
    <li>where required by applicable laws — including the Government Information (Public Access) Act 2009 (NSW) which may require us to publish or disclose certain information concerning the <strong>agreement</strong></li>
    <li>to relevant advisers, relevant ministers and other NSW government agencies or entities</li>
    <li>where it is already in the public domain for reasons other than a breach of this <strong>agreement</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You must not make any public statement regarding the agreement unless you have our prior consent.</p>

  <h2>7. Buyer data</h2>

  <p><strong>Buyer data</strong> means any data or information in any form:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>which is provided by us to you</li>
    <li>or which is stored, processed or generated by us, or by you on our behalf, in the course of performing the <strong>agreement</strong> or using the solution described in the <strong>solution requirements</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Buyer data</strong> excludes any <strong>systems metadata</strong> which is embedded in your systems and unable to be separated and transferred to us, where that data:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>is generated automatically in the course of operating your business and systems</li>
    <li>and does not relate specifically to us or any other NSW government agency or entity – including any of our operations, facilities, customers, clients, personnel, assets or programs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We own or control all <strong>buyer data</strong> from the time it is created, and it is our confidential information.</p>
  <p>We grant you a licence to use our <strong>buyer data</strong> for the purpose of performing the <strong>agreement</strong>. This licence is non-exclusive, non-transferable and royalty free, and it continues until the <strong>agreement</strong> terminates or expires.</p>

  <p>While <strong>buyer data</strong> is in your possession or is managed by you:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>you must enable us to access or extract the <strong>buyer data</strong> at any time</li>
    <li>you do not gain any other rights to the <strong>buyer data</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You may use the <strong>buyer data</strong> for the purpose of performing the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>
  <p>You may analyse the <strong>buyer data</strong> in de-identified form, without disclosing it to anyone outside your organisation, in order to improve your products and services.</p>
  <p>You must obtain our consent before you use the <strong>buyer data</strong> for any other purposes, whether in identified or de-identified form, including where you wish to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>commercially exploit <strong>buyer data</strong></li>
    <li>or use <strong>buyer data</strong> for data analytics or to target advertising to any of us</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Privacy</h2>

  <p><strong>Personal information</strong> has the meaning given to it in applicable <strong>privacy laws</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Privacy laws</strong> means the laws governing privacy as applicable in New South Wales and the Commonwealth of Australia, and includes any associated rules, codes of practice and guidelines made under those laws.</p>

  <p>Where you obtain <strong>personal information</strong> under the agreement, you must not:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>use or disclose it for any purpose other than performing the <strong>agreement</strong></li>
    <li>transfer it outside Australia</li>
    <li>or do anything that would cause us to be in breach of <strong>privacy laws</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You must tell us as soon as reasonably possible:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>if you are required to disclose <strong>personal information</strong> under applicable laws</li>
    <li>if you are approached by any privacy commissioner concerning <strong>personal information</strong> gained under the <strong>agreement</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>

  <p><strong>Security breach</strong> means:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>any unauthorised use of, loss of, access to or disclosure of <strong>buyer data</strong></li>
    <li>or any other security breach or data breach that is governed by applicable laws</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You must maintain a formal security program in accordance with industry standards which is comprehensive in terms of covering the solution described in the <strong>solution requirements</strong>. The security program must be designed to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>ensure the security and integrity of <strong>buyer data</strong></li>
    <li>protect against threats or hazards to the security or integrity of <strong>buyer data</strong></li>
    <li>and prevent any <strong>security breach</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you believe there has been a <strong>security breach</strong>, you must notify us within 48 hours, or any shorter period required by law.</p>

  <p>As soon as reasonably possible after becoming aware of any <strong>security breach</strong>, or where we advise you that we have reasonable cause to believe there has been a <strong>security breach</strong>, you must:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>conduct a root cause analysis and share the results of your analysis and your remediation plan with us on request</li>
    <li>and provide to us, to the extent known at the time:
      <ul>
        <li>the date of the <strong>security breach</strong></li>
        <li>a description of the <strong>security breach</strong></li>
        <li>a list of actions taken by you to mitigate the impact</li>
        <li>a summary of the information and <strong>buyer data</strong> lost, accessed or disclosed in the security breach</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Intellectual property</h2>

  <p>You grant us the intellectual property rights set out in the solution requirements.</p>

  <p>You confirm that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>you have all the intellectual property rights required to perform the <strong>agreement</strong> and to enable us to use the solution described in the <strong>solution requirements</strong> in accordance with the <strong>agreement</strong></li>
    <li>the rights you grant to us will not infringe any other person’s intellectual property rights</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A breach of the above is a breach of the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Existing materials</h3>

  <p>Either party may provide <strong>existing materials</strong> to the other. Existing materials are materials that are developed before the <strong>agreement</strong> commences or developed independently of the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>
  <p>The intellectual property rights in those <strong>existing materials</strong> remain with the party making them available or their licensors.</p>
  <p>Similarly, the intellectual property rights in any adaptation of those <strong>existing materials</strong> remain with the party making them available or their licensors.</p>

  <p>We license you to use our <strong>existing materials</strong> to perform the <strong>agreement</strong>. This licence is non-exclusive, non-transferable and royalty free.</p>
  <p>You license us to use your <strong>existing materials</strong> to exercise our rights under the <strong>agreement</strong>. This licence is non-exclusive, non-transferable and royalty free.</p>

  <h3>New materials</h3>
  <p><strong>New materials</strong> are materials created while performing the <strong>agreement</strong>, other than <strong>buyer data</strong> and <strong>existing materials</strong>.</p>

  <p>Where you create <strong>new materials</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>intellectual property rights in those <strong>new materials</strong> are owned by you</li>
    <li>you license us to use them for any purpose other than commercial exploitation</li>
    <li>this licence is non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual and royalty free</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By exception, alternative arrangements for particular items of <strong>new materials</strong> may be set out in the <strong>solution requirements</strong>.</p>

  <h2>11. Transparency</h2>

  <p>You agree to create and maintain records of your performance under the <strong>agreement</strong> in accordance with applicable laws and relevant industry practice and standards.</p>
  <p>We may inspect those records where we provide you with 7 days’ written notice. You agree to give us access and reasonable assistance.</p>

  <h2>12. Payment and invoicing</h2>

  <p>We agree to pay the fees set out in the <strong>agreement</strong>, other than disputed amounts:</p>

    <li>in accordance with the payment terms set out in the <strong>agreement</strong></li>
    <li>within 30 days following receipt of your valid tax invoice</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If we dispute any invoiced amount, we can withhold that disputed amount until the dispute is resolved.</p>

  <p>You must hold and maintain appropriate insurances, and comply with any specific insurance requirements in the <strong>solution requirements</strong>.</p>
  <p>If requested, you must provide a certificate of currency or other evidence proving you have appropriate cover for the performance of the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>

  <h2>14. Indemnity</h2>

  <p>You indemnify us and our personnel — including our officers, employees, agents, contractors and subcontractors — against any loss or damage arising out of, or connected with, a claim, demand or proceeding brought by a third party relating to any infringement, or alleged infringement, of a third party’s intellectual property rights in connection with our use of the solution provided by you.</p>

  <h2>15. Liability</h2>

  <p>Neither party is liable to the other for an amount greater than two times the agreement value, being the total amount paid or payable under the <strong>agreement</strong>.</p>
  <p>As an exception, liability is uncapped in relation to each of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>personal injury (including death) or damage to property</li>
    <li>a breach of a third party’s intellectual property rights</li>
    <li>a breach of confidentiality or privacy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These limitations on liability apply only to the extent permitted by law. Any limitations on liability that apply to us also apply to the State of New South Wales.</p>

  <h2>16.	Termination for cause</h2>

  <p>If either party breaches the <strong>agreement</strong>, and it is more than a trivial or inconsequential breach:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>which is not capable of remedy</li>
    <li>or which is not capable of remedy, but the other party fails to remedy it within 14 days of receiving notice asking them to do so</li>
  </ul>

  <p>then the other party can immediately give notice of termination</p>
